# Piano ScRoll - Vertical Piano Roll

## Description

I wanted a tool that can visualize MIDI files in a piano roll fashion but vertically, showing the keys that are being played at each moment. So I started making this using ChatGPT. I want to use that for learning more songs on the piano as I am not a big fan of conventional sheet notation and after years of struggle I don't feel bad about it anymore.

## Implementation
This was made mostly using Chat-GPT, proper prompt crafting and then minor changes for sake of functionality. The LLM was going wrong and crazy at times but I needed to provide concise instructions and focus on specific parts of the code that were wrong, such as the piano visualization sucked at first.
